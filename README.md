postcss-custom-plugin
--------------------

A simple project to demonstrate a custom post css plugin that prefixes all class names with `body`.

This uses a server which is available here `http://localhost:8080/build/html`

There is also a setup for a postcss mixin that automatically sets up a CSS @media query as the `@mixin mobile-layout`
